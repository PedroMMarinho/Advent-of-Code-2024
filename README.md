# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄  
Welcome to my solutions for the **Advent of Code 2024**! Join me on this festive coding adventure where I'll tackle daily programming puzzles with **Haskell** as well as **C++**. Let's dive into the holiday spirit with some programming magic! ✨  

## How to Run  
To explore and run my solutions, follow these simple steps:  

1. Open a terminal and start the GHCi interpreter:  
   ```bash  
   ghci  
   ```
2. Load the Haskell file for the specific day of the challenge:
    ```haskell
    :l <day>.hs  
    ```
3. Run the solution for that day:
   ```haskell
    <day>
    ```

Or

1. Open a terminal and start the compile the program:  
   ```bash  
   make
   ```

2. Run the compile binary file for the specific day of the challenge:
    ```bash
    ./<day>  
    ```
**Merry Christmas to everyone and Happy Holidays!** 🌟🎅🎁
